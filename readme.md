## React Install

That's all there is to get started. Next, let's actually setup a React project with Webpack. Before we go on, we'll need to install some dependencies.

```sh
npm i 
```
The dependencies above will help to install React and react-dom in our application. Since React is written in ES6, we'll need a way to transform the code. Webpack does that for you with no need for configs, all you have to do is install the presets and Webpack does all the heavy lifting for you.

## Project Run

```sh
npm start
```
