## Set Up A React Project With Webpack: 

React is the most popular javascript framework which is used by millions of developers around the globe. Creating a React app from Scratch is quite painful as it requires a lot of configuration. We all know that create-react-app gives a nice boilerplate to begin a journey with react, but it lacks some amount of configuration.

Note: In this article, we will learn how to configure the React with Webpack 4 and Babel 7 from scratch in some simple steps.

## Webpack and React

That's all there is to get started. Next, let's actually setup a React project with Webpack. Before we go on, we'll need to install some dependencies.

```sh
npm i react react-dom 
```
The dependencies above will help to install React and react-dom in our application. Since React is written in ES6, we'll need a way to transform the code. Webpack does that for you with no need for configs, all you have to do is install the presets and Webpack does all the heavy lifting for you.
